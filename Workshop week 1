// Array.map(): declarative function that accepts a callback as an argument

// let names = [];

//Declarative vs. Imperative
/* Declarative: "What" to do.
   Imperative: "How" to do it, step-by-step instructions.
*/

// Add a suffix of "Jr" to every person's name.

/* Declarative approach

function addJr(name) {
    return name + "Jr";
}

names.map(addJr); // map will create the loop and return to our callback the item it's inspecting

Array.find(); // declarative function to help search an array.

//DOM Query/Manipulation tool:
DOM is an object representation of every element.
