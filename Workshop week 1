// Array.map(): declarative function that accepts a callback as an argument

// let names = [];

//Declarative vs. Imperative
/* Declarative: "What" to do.
   Imperative: "How" to do it, step-by-step instructions.
*/

// Add a suffix of "Jr" to every person's name.

/* Declarative approach

function addJr(name) {
    return name + "Jr";
}

names.map(addJr); // map will create the loop and return to our callback the item it's inspecting

Array.find(); // declarative function to help search an array.

//DOM Query/Manipulation tool:
DOM is an object representation of every element.

/* Regular Expressions:

    Syntax: Two forward slashes /<set of rules>/
    Rules: character set called "tokens" -- [A-z]

    Use: uses the rule to validate against some user input. */

// let regex = /[j-p]+/; // Rule says must have at least 1 character from 'j' - 'p'. 

/* the set of rules need to go inside between square brackets []. */

// regex = /^\s$/; // ^ indicates the start of the string, what comes after is the enforcement.
                // Must start and end with a space {white space character}/
